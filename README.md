# How I found this.
- To start I added Continent from the table under the data section to the column section.
- After I added BMI and Cholesterol to the Rows and filtered them to show Average instead of Sum.

## *How I changed the Measurement*
- To find where to change the Measure from SUM to AVERAGE next to BMI in the rows I clicked the **down arrow**.
- Then I **placed my cursor above "Measure (Sum)"** and changed it to Average.
