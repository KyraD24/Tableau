# How I found this 
- To start I added Continent from the table under the data section to the column section.
- After I added BMI and Cholesterol to the Rows and filtered them to show AVG instead of sum.

# How to change the Measurement
- To find where to change the measure from SUM to AVERAGE next to BMI in the rows I clicked the down arrow.
-Then I placed my cursor about "Measure (sum)" and changed it to Average.
