# How I found this 
- To start I added Continent from the table under the data section to the column section.
- After I added BMI and Cholesterol to the Rows and filtered them to show AVG instead of sum.
- To find where to change the measure from SUM to AVERAGE next to BMI in the rows I clicked the down arrow and pressed the side arrow to show many different Measurements I selected Average and done the same for Cholesterol.
- To display the different genders I took Gender from the Table uder the Data section and dragged it to Marks and changed the colour.
